emini Home puts the weather forecast, one headline, a note in your own words,
the sky above you and the air you breathe on the NOTE4C's 400 × 300 display, using its black, white, red and
yellow pigments. You set it up in your phone's browser, without an app or an
account. After that the device does the rest on its own, and no emini.ink
server sits in between.

## One forecast, three compositions

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/epaper-weather-rhythm.png" width="400" alt="Rhythm composition: a sample forecast for Lisbon with a dithered temperature curve for the next hours">
  <img src="docs/images/epaper-weather-atlas.png" width="400" alt="Atlas composition: the same sample forecast with a large sun and cloud on the left half">
</p>
<p align="center"><sub>Rhythm and Atlas, drawn on a computer by the 0.5.0 renderer from sample data. The photo at the top shows Print.</sub></p>

Rhythm draws the coming hours as a curve, and Atlas gives the sky half of the
page. Each screen can keep one composition, or use **In turn** and move on to
the next one each time it comes back to the display. The weather screen shows
the range for the next 24 hours under the temperature and a short line about precipitation,
such as “Rain from 18:00”.

There is no grey on this display, so the renderer mixes the four pigments in
ordered dither patterns to draw warmth, light and cloud. Coloured patterns are
never finer than 2 pixels, while black and paper patterns can still use single
pixels.

## Sky and Air

Two more screens arrived in 0.5.0, both switched off until you enable them in the panel.
**Sky** shows sunrise, sunset, the length of the day and the Moon's phase, worked out on the
device from your saved location; nothing is downloaded for it. **Air** shows the European
air quality index, PM2.5 over the next 24 hours, the UV index with a sunscreen hint and,
in Europe, four pollens, from Open-Meteo's Air Quality service (CC BY 4.0). Each has the
same three compositions as the weather.

## Pokémon of the day (local development build)

This checkout adds an optional Pokémon screen: a sprite and English Pokédex
introduction, downloaded directly by the device and cached for the day. Enable
it under **Home → Pokémon** in the phone panel. No backend or API key is needed.
See [setup and implementation notes](docs/POKEMON.md).

## Your brush

Four pigments and no grey mean every tone on this display is a pattern. Since 0.5.0 the
panel lets you choose the brush that paints it, in Settings → Appearance: grain (blue noise,
the default), halftone dots, or the ordered grid of the earlier versions. The renderer was measured on a real NOTE4C with test
cards before this release; yellow needs two pixels to exist at all, so no brush ever draws
it finer.

## One headline and your note

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/epaper-news-print.png" width="400" alt="The News screen: one headline from a news feed">
  <img src="docs/images/epaper-note-rhythm.png" width="400" alt="The Your note screen: a personal note in large type above a dithered band">
</p>
<p align="center"><sub>News and Your note, drawn from sample data</sub></p>

News comes from BBC World by default, or from a public RSS or Atom feed of your
choice, as long as it is served over HTTPS. The note is yours: a reminder, a
line from a friend, a few words to keep in view.

Headlines and notes in Simplified Chinese are drawn with Noto Sans CJK glyphs
(the whole of GB 2312, 6 763 characters, plus punctuation); lines break between
characters, so a Chinese feed such as a news site's RSS works as it is. Since
0.5.1 the screens themselves speak Simplified Chinese too: every label, footer
and sentence, the date as 9月15日, and air quality, UV and pollen by name.
Choose the language in the phone panel, or hold the lower side button for five
seconds on the device.

## Set it up from your phone

On first start the display shows a setup screen. Join the **emini.ink** Wi-Fi
network it shows, open `http://192.168.4.1`, type the pairing code from the
display, and move the device onto your home network. From then on the panel
lives at the device's own address on that network (Settings → Your device);
the setup network exists only for the 5-minute setup window. Then search for your town,
pick your screens and their compositions, and choose one screen, a day rhythm
or a rotation, with quiet hours for the night.

The [phone panel guide](docs/PANEL.md) walks through every step.

## Install

The short way is the web installer at [esp32ai.me/install](https://esp32ai.me/install?fw=emini-home):
open it in Chrome or Edge, plug the NOTE4C in with a USB-C data cable and give it the
firmware, either as a file you downloaded from the release or as a link to it.

The careful way needs `esptool` and a terminal. The
[installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md) has eight steps, and most of the time
goes into two full backups. In short:

1. Back up the whole flash twice.
2. Run [`tools/preflight.py`](tools/preflight.py) on the backups. It compares
   them with the tested NOTE4C and says `READY` or `STOP`.
3. Write two files from the [0.5.0 release](https://github.com/fiedoruk/emini-home/releases/tag/v0.5.0):
   the partition table at `0x8000` and the application at `0x20000`. The
   bootloader and factory data stay untouched.
4. Verify, start and continue on your phone.

## Status

Where 0.5.0 stands:

- **Tested on one NOTE4C Devkit** (ESP32-S3, 16 MiB flash, factory partition
  layout). This release was written and verified on that unit with the
  sequence from the installation guide: backups, preflight check, write and
  verify.
- **Phone setup** has been done end to end from an iPhone on that unit, from
  the setup Wi-Fi to the panel on the home network. Android phones have not
  been tried yet.
- **Starting over**, which erases only the settings area, has been done on
  that unit: the area read back empty and Home opened the setup screen.
- **A full picture change takes about 25 seconds**, measured on that unit
  over USB power.
- **Location** comes from a town you search for in the panel, or from an
  estimate based on your internet address, which can land on your provider's
  city.
- **Battery life is short.** On the tested unit, with three screens taking turns
  every twenty minutes, a full charge lasted roughly a day and a half. Wi-Fi stays
  on and there is no sleep of any kind yet, which is where nearly all of that goes.
  The panel shows voltage and a rough percentage.
- **Going back to the factory firmware** uses the standard esptool procedure
  and has not yet been tried on a real unit.
- **Updates** are installed over USB. There is no over-the-air update mechanism.

If you install it, a [hardware report](https://github.com/fiedoruk/emini-home/issues/new?template=hardware-report.yml)
helps the next person decide.

## Privacy

Home talks to MET Norway for weather, to the news feed you choose, to FreeIPAPI
for an approximate location and to public time servers. While the Air screen is
switched on, it also sends the saved coordinates to the Open-Meteo Air Quality
API for air quality, UV and pollen. When you search for a town, your phone's
browser sends the search to Open-Meteo. Each of these services sees an ordinary
request from your internet address. Nothing goes to emini, and the firmware has
no analytics. The panel runs over HTTP on your local network and settings are
stored on the device without encryption, so keep the device on a network and in
a home you trust. Details: [privacy](docs/PRIVACY.md).

## Build it yourself

The firmware builds with ESP-IDF v6.0 and nothing else; see
[building from source](docs/BUILD.md). Hardware details and the flash layout
are in [hardware](docs/HARDWARE.md).

## How it was built

One person directing two AI coding agents, Claude Code and Codex. I set the
direction, made the calls and tested the firmware on a NOTE4C.
